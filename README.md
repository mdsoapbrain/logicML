# logicML Pipeline

The `logicML` package offers a Python class, `logicML`, that facilitates streamlined machine learning model training and evaluation utilizing the H2O AutoML library. The package encompasses a rich set of methods for data preparation, training, evaluating, and visualizing the performance of the models using various charts and metrics.

## Installation

Before installing the `logicML` package, ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. After confirming your Python installation, follow the steps below to install the `logicML` package:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdsoapbrain/logicML.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the package directory (the one containing `setup.py`) and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Install the Package

Install the `logicML` package with the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

## Usage

To utilize the `logicML` class, import it in your Python script and follow the guide below:

### Step 1: Import the Class and Load Data

Import the `logicML` class and load your training and testing data as Pandas dataframes. Your data should be structured such that the last column contains the target variable, and one of the columns should contain the variable to be removed.

```python
from logicML import logicML
import pandas as pd

# Load your data (replace with your actual data paths)
train_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/train_data.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/test_data.csv')
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Pipeline

Initialize the `logicML` with your data and other optional parameters:

```python
pipeline = logicML(train_df, test_df, target_var='your_target_variable', remove_var='variable_to_remove')
```


### Step 3: Execute the entire pipeline in one go (with an optional threshold parameter)
pipeline.execute_pipeline(threshold='best')

# Alternatively, you can execute each stage individually as shown below:

# Stage 1: Plot the ROC curve and determine the best threshold
pipeline.stage_one()

# Stage 2: Using the threshold determined in stage one (or a custom threshold) to proceed with feature importance and top N features
pipeline.stage_two(threshold='best') # replace 'best' with a custom threshold if needed

# Stage 3: Perform permutations and combinations on top N features and plot the final ROC curve and confusion matrix
pipeline.stage_three()


## Data Format

Your `train_df` and `test_df` should adhere to the following format:

- **train_df & test_df**: Pandas dataframes where:
  - The last column should be the target variable.
  - Should include a column that you wish to remove before training (specified in `remove_var` parameter).
  - All other columns should be feature variables used for training the model.

### Example:

```plaintext
| Feature1 | Feature2 | ... | FeatureN | remove_var | target_var |
|----------|----------|-----|----------|------------|------------|
| 1.1      | 2.2      | ... | 3.3      | 0          | 1          |
| 4.4      | 5.5      | ... | 6.6      | 1          | 0          |
```

## Class Methods
